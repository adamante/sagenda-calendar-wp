**Shortcode**
You can use Sagenda as shortcode in any page or plugin :
`[sagenda-calendar-wp]`

You can force the Calendar to display only one bookable item. Please then use the shortcode like this :
`[sagenda-calendar-wp fixedbookableitem="x"]`
where x is the "id" of your bookable item. To know the id of your bookable item, you can just go to your bookable item list :  [https://sagenda.net/BookableItems/List](https://sagenda.net/BookableItems/List) and select "edit". You can then copy the ID with the copy button. 
You can also use this feature with URL query parameter such as adding ?fixedbookableitem="x" to your URL. Please don't use both shortcode and query parameter "fixedbookableitem" in the same time. 

You can choose the default view 
`[sagenda-calendar-wp defaultView="x"]`
where x is the "month", "week" or "day".

You can unactivate view(s)
`[sagenda-calendar-wp removeMonthViewButton="true" removeWeekViewButton="true" removeDayViewButton="true"]`
This will simply remove the corresponding button to switch from a view to another one.
